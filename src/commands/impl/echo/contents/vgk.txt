Fun game, but the outcome was 100% determined by one horrible call on the ice. Unfortunate, and hopefully it sparks a change in how they blindly call penalties based on injuries. There wasn't even a call being made until they saw an injured player on the ice, that is NOT how a game should be officiated. Friedman was correct in stating the officials got scared and made a horrible judgement call, and completely changed the outcome of the game.

I can't imagine how the Vegas players feel after that garbage, they were robbed of that series win. I really hope that Gallant just rips the refs after the game, they deserve it and they also should not officiate another playoff game.

Edit: To those saying it was the PK's fault for the outcome; You can view it that way, sure, but if that horrendous call wasn't made then the PK wouldn't have even been on the ice. So I will completely disagree with the opinion that this game is on the PK, simply because the officials handed SJ momentum and a way back into the game, none of those goals happen without that awful call. The game was 3-0 and Vegas was coasting to a series win, the game was all but over. Without that call being made I have no doubt in my mind that Vegas easily wins the game, so yes, it 100% changed the outcome.

Edit2: For anybody stating it's the correct call, the "crosscheck" by Statsny (Completely different player) is not what injured him, his awkward fall and hitting his head injured him. It's two minutes at most, and personally I believe that if he doesn't fall and slam his head on the ice then there's no call made on the play at all (Which no official had their arm up before seeing an injured player). Horrible call and there is absolutely no justification for five minutes, it's extremely obviously the officials didn't even see the play. Stop calling penalties based on assumptions.
